Hospital Data Analysis: Descriptive Insights & Statistical Hypothesis Testing

In this project, I explored a hospital dataset to reveal key insights about facility resources and patient outcomes. I transformed categorical variables, visualized distributions, and computed correlationsâ€”illuminating links between staff, beds, and death rates. Finally, I performed hypothesis testing (Wilcoxon and t-tests) and generated confidence intervals for stroke patients, highlighting robust statistical analysis for evidence-based healthcare decisions.
